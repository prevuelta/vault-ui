## Configuration
Configuration is accessed by clicking on the configuration cog on the login page.

### Vault Endpoint
Users can enter in the full endpoint to Vault, including scheme.  When running the docker image, it is possible to
set the following environment variables to pre-configure authentication settings:
- `VAULT_URL_DEFAULT` will set the default vault endpoint.
- `VAULT_AUTH_DEFAULT` will set the default authentication method type. See below for supported authentication methods.
- `VAULT_AUTH_BACKEND_PATH` will set the default backend path. Useful when multiple backends of the same type are mounted on the vault file system.

This defaults can be overridden if the user fills out the endpoint and auth method manually.

## Authentication
Currently supported authentication methods:
- `GITHUB` : When using the [GitHub](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/github.html) backend
- `USERNAMEPASSWORD` : When using the [Username & Password](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/userpass.html) or [RADIUS](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/radius.html) backends
- `LDAP` : When using the [LDAP](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/ldap.html) backend
- `TOKEN` : When using the [Tokens](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/token.html) backend

### Token authentication by header (SSO)
In some cases, users might want to use middleware to authenticate into Vault-UI for purposes like SSO. In this case, the `VAULT_SUPPLIED_TOKEN_HEADER` may be populated with the name of the header that contains a token to be used for authentication.

## Secrets
![Secrets Management](https://github.com/djenriquez/vault-ui/raw/master/images/Secrets.png)

Secrets are now managed using the graphical [josdejong/jsoneditor](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor) JSON editor. Schema validation is enforced on policies to aid the operator in writing correct syntax.
![New Secrets](https://github.com/djenriquez/vault-ui/raw/master/images/NewSecret.png)

Secrets also are accessible directly by key from a browser by navigating to the URI `/secrets/<mount>/<namespace>/key`. For example, if you have a generic secret key of /hello/world/vault using the generic mount `secret`, one can navigate to this directly through http://vault-ui.myorg.com/secrets/secret/hello/world/vault.

### Root key bias
By default, secrets will display as their raw JSON value represented by the `data` field in the HTTP GET response metadata. However, users can apply a "Root Key" bias to the secrets through the settings page. The "Root Key" will be used when reading, creating and updating secrets such that the value displayed in the UI is the value stored at the "Root Key". For example, if the secret at `secret/hello` is `{ "value": "world" }`, setting the "Root Key" to `value` will update the UI such that the secret will display as simply "world" instead of `{ "value": "world" }`.

## Policies
Policies are managed also using the [josdejong/jsoneditor](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor) JSON editor. Currently, GitHub and raw Tokens are the only supported authentication backends for associated policies.

## Token Management

Users now have the ability to create and revoke tokens.

## Response Wrapping
Vault-UI supports response-wrapping raw values. It currently does not support wrapping of existing secrets.

## Run
Vault-UI Docker images are automatically built using an [automated build on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/djenriquez/vault-ui/builds/). We encourage that versioned images are used for production.
To run Vault-UI using the latest Docker image:
```bash
docker run -d \
-p 8000:8000 \
--name vault-ui \
djenriquez/vault-ui
```

### Skip TLS Verification
In the case that you need to skip TLS verification, say for self-signed certs, you can run Vault-UI with the environment variable `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`:
```
docker run -d \
-p 8000:8000 \
-e NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 \
--name vault-ui \
djenriquez/vault-ui
```

## Development

### With Docker
The command below will use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
to spin up a Vault dev server and a Vault UI server that you can log
into with username "test" and password "test":
```sh
./run-docker-compose-dev
```

If major changes are made, be sure to run `docker-compose build` to rebuild dependencies.

### Without Docker
The following will spin up a Vault UI server only. It will not set up
Vault for you:
```sh
npm install

# If you do not have webpack installed globally
npm install -g webpack

npm start
webpack -w
```
